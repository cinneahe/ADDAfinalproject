    A Miami native, Cai Thomas (20), a junior Communications and Film Studies major at Boston College holds the prestigious designations as both the 2015 Boston College Martin Luther King Jr. and as a Jackie Robinson Foundation Scholar for her academic achievements and commitment to service. <br><br>
    Thomas has produced and directed a number of film projects, including an eight-part documentary chronicling last year’s Robsham Theater production of “For Colored Girls.” She recently completed a documentary on 2013 BC alumna Blake Bolden, a black professional hockey player for the Boston Blades. Thomas shadowed Bolden for a month, following her from the ice to the locker room to her day job at Innercity Weightlifting, which provides young adults with an alternative to violence and gangs.<br><br>
    Thomas spends her time outside of filmmaking as co-host of The Molly Bean Show, a weekly talk show on WZBC. She enjoys playing basketball, following the work of other Black women filmmakers, and aspiring for greatness. </div>
